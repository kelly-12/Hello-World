# Hello-World
Climate data analytics

I am at my best in a job where I can
work with other people, and have
some level of both independence and
collaboration in decision-making. I
can succeed in performing complex
tasks and processes within a tight
schedule, and varying work suits me
very well. I display great curiosity and
attempt to fit my diverse experiences
into a clear understanding of the
world.
